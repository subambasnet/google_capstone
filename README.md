I conducted an in-depth analysis of Cyclistic, a Chicago-based bike-sharing company, utilizing R. Through this analysis, I developed an interactive dashboard that illustrates the distinct usage patterns between annual members and casual riders. Additionally, I formulated targeted marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members for Cyclistic.

## Background

Cyclistic, a fictional bike-sharing venture, boasts an extensive network comprising more than 5,800 bikes and 600 docking stations. Notably, the program prioritizes inclusivity by offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, catering to individuals with disabilities and those unable to use traditional two-wheeled bicycles. Established in 2016, Cyclistic has witnessed substantial growth, expanding into a significant fleet of geotracked bicycles strategically stationed across 692 locations in Chicago. A noteworthy feature allows users to unlock bikes from one station and return them conveniently to any other station within the network. The analysis is based on the most recent available data.
I used R to process and analyze the data as part the files were huge and it is easier to process compared to Excel and SQL. Visualization was done in Tableau to practice and create an interactive dashboard.
